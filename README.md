This project is an extension of [plexe](github.com/michele-segata/plexe) (3.0) which implements a protocol to make a platoon change lane safely.

A FSM of the maneuver, and a high level message description, are in the maneuverDoc folder.

Several tests can be made changing settings on the ini file; the most interesting is the "safety distance" from other vehicles in the lane destination. 10m can be a good starting point.
